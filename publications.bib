abstract = {Contemporary digital maps provide an option for pedestrian navigation, but they do not account for subjective preferences in the calculation of the shortest path, which is usually provided in terms of absolute distance. For this purpose, we performed a controlled experiment with local pedestrians, who were asked to navigate from point A to point B in a fast manner. The pedestrians’ routes were recorded by means of a GPS device and then plotted on a map for comparison with suggested itinerary from a digital map. We found that the preferred shortest path is significantly different to the suggested one. Notably, the preffered paths were slightly longer than the suggested, but there was no effect in the trip duration because there were fewer obstacles, such as cars. Since many pedestrians employ GPS enabled devices, the findings of this research inform the development of mobile applications and the design of new subjective map layers for city dwellers.},

abstract = {We present a user-based approach for detecting interesting video segments through simple signal processing of users' collective interactions with the video player (e.g., seek/scrub, play, pause). Previous research has focused on content-based systems that have the benefit of analyzing a video without user interactions, but they are monolithic, because the resulting key-frames are the same regardless of the user preferences. We developed the open-source SocialSkip system on a modular cloud-based architecture and analyzed hundreds of user interactions within difficult video genres (lecture, how-to, documentary) by modeling them as user interest time series. We found that the replaying activity is better than the skipping forward one in matching the semantics of a video, and that all interesting video segments can be found within a factor of two times the average user skipping step from the local maximums of the replay time series. The concept of simple signal processing of implicit user interactions within video could be applied to any type of Web video system (e.g., TV, desktop, tablet), in order to improve the user navigation experience with dynamic and personalized key-frames.},

Although there is significant research literature within the individual domains of usability and of video learning, there is limited understanding of their integrated design. In particular, there is limited research on guidelines for usable video lecture design, such as the presence of humans in the video and navigation support through the video. For example, it is established that learners benefit from highly structured learning material, but the manual editing of video is not feasible for most learning organizations and instructors. In order to accommodate this emerging instruction medium we are drawing design principles and models from the research literature on educational technology and video interaction. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive approach to the design of usable video lecture systems and content. Finally, we suggest that learning organizations and instructors should invest additional effort in video systems that support an integrated approach to editing, sharing, and controlling of video lectures.},

abstract = {Content-based video retrieval has been a very efficient technique with new video content, but it has not regarded the increasingly dynamic interactions between users and content. We present a comprehensive survey on user-based techniques and instrumentation for social video retrieval researchers. Community-based approaches suggest there is much to learn about an unstructured video just by analyzing the dy- namics of how it is being used. In particular, we explore three pillars of online user activity with video content: 1) Seeking patterns within a video is linked to interesting video segments, 2) Sharing patterns between users indicate that there is a correlation between social activity and popularity of a video, and 3) Editing of live events is automated through the synchronization of audio across multiple viewpoints of the same event. Moreover, we present three complementary research methods in social video retrieval: Experimental replication of user activity data and signal analysis, data mining and prediction on natural user activity data, and hybrid techniques that combine robust content-based approaches with crowd sourcing of user gener- ated content. Finally, we suggest further research directions in the combination of richer user- and content-modeling, because it provides an attractive solution to the personalization, navigation, and social consumption of videos.},

For this purpose, we designed a between groups experiment with eighty students (12 to 13 years old). They formed three equivalent groups of twenty students each who practiced with a serious game in three different ways. The first group played the storytelling game, the second played the same game but with no story, and the third was engaged with modifying the game code. Finally, the last (control) group practiced traditionally by solving exercises on paper. We found that girls with low grades benefited the most by playing the game and by engaging with the code and that the game making group wishes to repeat the exercise. Further research should perform similar studies with a focus on involving students in serious game modification, over longer periods of time and for additional curriculum topics.},

abstract = {Sports tracking software for casual exercising has become popular with smart phone users who are concerned about their health and fitness. Nevertheless, there is limited research on the user requirements for sports tracking software, which needs to be fun and easy to use in order to appeal to a broad set of users. For this purpose, we employed a four-week long experiment with five users who were asked to perform multiple workouts with two levels of gamification. The first treatment stands for no gamification and the second treatment provided rich visual feedback, such as speed, distance, elapsed time, map. At the end of the experiment, we asked users to describe the devices. Both devices included GPS sensor, so we also measured the distance covered for each one of the workouts. We found that augmented feedback from mobile self-tracking devices can promote working out, but there is also a trade-off of increased anxiety and disorientation. Thus, we suggest that sports tracking software should be modest about how much and what type of visual information it provides to the user. In particular, we found that the only piece of visual information that had an impact on performance was average speed, which indicates a connection with gamication. Further research should consider additional levels of gamification beyond score, such as graphics, sociability, rules.},

In particular, there is limited research about the effects of each presentation style on student learning performance and attitudes. In this work, we examine the effects of video presentation styles in supporting the teaching of mathematics in the secondary education. In addition to a control group that studied through a paper-book, two groups of students attended two distinct styles of video lectures: 1) video capture of class teaching (Talking head style), and 2) close-up video capture of an interactive drawing board with voice-over (Khan style). The participants of our study consisted of 36 students (15 boys and 21 girls, 16 years old), who received the respective three treatments (paper book, talking head, khan style), over the course of three math modules in three weeks’ time. We found that learning effects show up only after the second week and that the Talking Head style was more effective than the book for complex topics.},

We developed an informal learning activity with quiz questions about art theory, which we integrated in a between–groups experimental design with three groups of high–school students at an art gallery. Each of the three groups received a different treatment: (a) an interactive mobile–based learning activity, (b) a paper–based version of the same learning activity, and (c) a self–guided museum tour. Students who enrolled with the interactive version showed higher performance in the post–assessment test when compared to the paper–based version. Notably, the benefits of the interactive version are attributed to the immediate feedback of the quiz application during the visit. Further research should perform similar controlled experiments in order to assess the learning benefit of more immersive interactive systems, such as three–dimensional graphics and augmented reality.},

Data analysis reveals that the art installation engaged users, with focus on young children, and communicated the intended message. The results are organized according to five important factors for developing and evaluating interacting art installations. These are: 1) data collection method; 2) user interaction; 3) social interaction; 4) issues about children; 5) message comprehension.

We propose a pulse modeling method, which analyzes implicit user interactions within web video, such as rewind. In particular, we have modeled the user information seeking behavior as a time series and the semantic regions as a discrete pulse of fixed width. We constructed these pulses from user interactions with a documentary video that has a very rich visual style with too many cuts and camera angles/frames for the same scene. Next, we calculated the correlation coefficient between dynamically detected user pulses at the local maximums and the reference pulse. We have found when people are actively seeking for information in a video, their activity (these pulses) significantly matches the semantics of the video. This proposed pulse analysis method complements previous work in content-based information retrieval and provides an additional user-based dimension for modeling the semantics of a web video.},

abstract = {This article investigates the uses and gratifications of the popular social networking site Facebook. In the exploratory stage, 70 users generated phrases to describe the manner they used Facebook. Interestingly, some users not only described the uses, but also mentioned how they perceive these uses. These phrases were coded into 14 items and clustered into four factors. The principal component analysis that was conducted in the third stage of the study, which was addressed to 222 Facebook users, verified the validity of the four factors: Social Connection, Social Network Surfing, Wasting Time and Using Applications. Previous user studies on Facebook have examined the immediate social effects of this popular social networking site, but they have not regarded emerging uses of the platform, such as gaming and applications, which do have a social component as a feature and not as a core principle. The ?Wasting Time? factor and the growth of ?Using Applications? factor indicate that Facebook has already become an integral part of daily computing routine, alongside with the rest of the entertainment desktop and web applications. This article investigates the uses and gratifications of the popular social networking site Facebook. In the exploratory stage, 70 users generated phrases to describe the manner they used Facebook. Interestingly, some users not only described the uses, but also mentioned how they perceive these uses. These phrases were coded into 14 items and clustered into four factors. The principal component analysis that was conducted in the third stage of the study, which was addressed to 222 Facebook users, verified the validity of the four factors: Social Connection, Social Network Surfing, Wasting Time and Using Applications. Previous user studies on Facebook have examined the immediate social effects of this popular social networking site, but they have not regarded emerging uses of the platform, such as gaming and applications, which do have a social component as a feature and not as a core principle.

Nevertheless, little research has been done with regard to children and VMC. In this paper, we explore the behavior of a group of children, who exchanged video messages in an informal context. In particular, this paper presents the results of 11-week VMC study of 30 children from the USA and Greece, exploring children’s behavior with the asynchronous video-based messaging tool we developed called VideoPal. In the study, children’s interactions, perceptions, content exchanged and emotions were collected. The results from the analyses highlight that the emotion of happiness dominated in the communication. Moreover, the content included useful personal information and is connected with children’s interactions (e.g., number of views and of recipients). In addition, children generally preferred VideoPal to email because they felt that it was easier and has more fun.},

However, limited research has been made on the design and assessment of the storytelling elements and the educational effectiveness of these games in sciences curricula. For this purpose, we used Scratch to develop a storytelling mathematics video game and then we measured its educational effect to a small group of twelve students. We found that the story-based math video game has captivated the interest of students and it has been beneficial in the improvement of their performance in an assessment test. Most notably, the improvement was higher for students who used to have poor performance in mathematics. In practice, educators should develop similar games for similar science topics (e.g., physics, chemistry, etc), while further research should consider the active involvement of students in the design of serious games.},

This study is about a storytelling serious video game, which has the goal to improve the mathematical skills of players. The game has a plot, featuring a story in which a mission is assigned to the player. The story and the mission are used to stimulate the students’ interest and motivate them to play the game. The empirical study is a controlled experiment to which 46 Gymnasium (middle school) students participated. Results confirmed the positive effects of the enjoyment on students’ intention to use storytelling serious games. Notably, we found that gender has a moderating effect on the relationships between enjoyment and intention to use the game. The results of this study suggest that games with a storytelling component might be attractive to girls.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a user-based event detection method for social web videos. Previous research in event detection has focused on content-based techniques, such as pattern recognition algorithms that attempt to understand the contents of a video. There are few user-centric approaches that have considered either search keywords, or external data such as comments, tags, and annotations. Moreover, some of the user-centric approaches imposed an extra effort to the users in order to capture required information. In this research, we are describing a method for the analysis of implicit users’ interactions with a web video player, such as pause, play, and thirty-seconds skip or rewind. The results of our experiments indicated that even the simple user heuristic of local maxima might effectively detect the same video-events, as indicated manually. Notably, the proposed technique was more accurate in the detection of events that have a short duration, because those events motivated increased user interaction in video hot-spots. The findings of this research provide evidence that we might be able to infer semantics about a piece of unstructured data just from the way people actually use it.},

As a test bench to verify our idea we have extended the YouTube video player into the VideoSkip system. In addition, VideoSkip uses a web-database (Google Application Engine) to keep a record of some important parameters, such as the timing of basic user actions (play, pause, skip). Moreover, we implemented an algorithm that selects representative thumbnails. Finally, we populated the system with data from an experiment with nine users. We found that the VideoSkip system indexes video content by leveraging implicit users interactions, such as pause and thirty seconds skip. Our early findings point toward improvements of the web video player and its thumbnail generation technique. The VideSkip system could compliment content-based algorithms, in order to achieve efficient video-indexing in difficult videos, such as lectures or sports.},

In this study, we explore the effect of in- creasing levels of interactivity on learning performance and students’ intention for future museum visits. We developed an educational mobile application based on QR codes and quiz software, in order to augment visual arts comprehension during a visit to an art gallery. In addition to the mobile-based version of the game, a paper-based version was also employed followed by a controlled experiment. A total of 60 lyceum students (between 15 and 16 years old) participated in a between-groups evaluation that compared the performance of three levels of interactivity (passive guided tour, paper-based, mobile-based), as well as the perceptions among the groups. The results indicate that the mobile-based student group had higher performance in the post-assessment when compared with the paper-based one. Notably, perceived interest for the game affects students’ perceptions for a future museum visit. Further research should consider the effects of higher-fidelity types of mobile applications, such as 3D graphics, as well as augmented-reality games.},

Previous research in user-based techniques has assumed an extra effort from the users, such as video replies, comments, tags, and annotations. We have developed and evaluated the SocialSkip system, which improves sense making of web videos by visualizing the simplest form of user interactions with video, such as pause, and seek. In contrast to previous stand-alone implementations, the SocialSkip system employs a web-video player and cloud-based resources (application logic, database, content). The system was validated with two user studies, which provided several hundreds of user interactions with five types of web video (sports, comedy, lecture, documentary, how-to). We found that seeking activity within web video is reversely proportional to how interesting the video is. Moreover, we suggest that if the users are actively seeking for information within a video (e.g., lecture, how-to), then the user activity graph could be associated with the semantics of the video. Finally, SocialSkip provides an open architecture for collaborative contributions to the analysis of the user activity data, in a fashion similar to the TRECVID workshop series.},

We found that users with more elaborate avatars had a higher success rate in their social encounters, than those users with the default avatars. Most notably, female users selected to speak with male avatars much more frequently, when using the attractive avatar, which indicates a self-confidence effect induced by the appearance of the personal avatar.},

Moreover, the first wave of research has been mostly concerned with technology and standards, which are necessary to ensure interoperability and market acceptance. Although, there has been a significant body of computer-supported co-operative work (CSCW) and mobile human–computer interaction (HCI) research findings, there is limited investigation in the context of leisure activities, such as TV. In this article, we propose three concepts that drive the main paths for research and practice in mobile and social TV: (1) Mobile TV as a content format, (2) Mobile TV as user behavior, and (3) Mobile TV as interaction terminal. Finally, we provide particular directions to be considered in further research in social and mobile TV.},

For this purpose, several layers of cartographic information were employed in a computer application, which was programmed with motion-tracking libraries in the open source tool processing. The interactive video installation has been chosen as a medium to achieve the following aims: (1) The visualization of urban-conflict as an interactive map narrative, and (2) the encouragement of social encounters through a shared screen. The development process begins with the design of interaction between the system and the participants, as well as between the participants themselves. Then we map the interaction design concepts into multimedia and architectural design. Finally, we provide a discussion on the creative process and the collaboration between different disciplines, such as architecture, urban planning, cartography, computer engineering, and media studies.},

In the exploratory stage, 70 users generated phrases to describe the manner they used Facebook. Interestingly, some users do not only describe the uses, but also mention how they perceive these uses. These phrases were coded into 14 items and then clustered into 4 factors. The second stage of the study, which was addressed to 131 Facebook users, the factor analysis that was conducted, verified the validity of the four factors: Social Connection, Social Network Surfing, Wasting Time, Using Applications. Finally, the results were analyzed in order to interpret each factor's impact and to enable a comparison with previous research regarding the same subject. These showed how users continue to primarily regard Facebook as a means of socializing with other users, but also the extent to which Facebook has become a part of their daily routine, something that is indicated by the impact of the "Wasting Time" factor. Further research can be conducted by addressing a greater number of users, selected with a less random manner and possibly with a different (cultural, economical etc.) background.},

Despite research findings that indicate the special needs and skills of senior citizens, contemporary handsets offer limited consideration for them. We investigated whether typical mobile phone icons are suitable for older users, as measured through unaided icon comprehension. For this purpose, we studied 38 users and evaluated 25 icons, which we captured from five different handsets. It was found that there are significant differences in icon comprehension performance between older and younger mobile phone users. We conclude that designers of mobile phone icons have to regard older user groups differently and we describe the qualities of icons suitable to each one of the age groups.

It was found that there are significant differences between alternative icons used for the same mobile phone feature. Moreover, we found that original manufacturer icons performed better than those offered by the wireless operator. Simple metaphors from the real world and consistent visual depictions across different handsets performed best for mobile phone icons, while abstract concepts had the lowest recognition rates. Designers of mobile phone icons have to balance a trade-off between the need of the manufacturers and wireless operators to differentiate their offerings through branding, and the need of the consumers for a familiar visual language in mobile phone menus.},

@incollection{Willis2010,
abstract = {The approach often adopted by Human Computer Interaction (HCI) focuses on exchanges between a person and the interface of a device situated within a specific context of use. This view is increasingly challenged by the complex and dynamic world of the physical and social environment integrated with ubiquitous technologies, which requires an alternative view that sees people creating settings which frame and structure their encounters. As a result, in recent years, HCI researchers have recognized the need for social and physical data to be gathered and interpreted, but have often been frustrated in their attempts to codify and make sense of the complex and dynamic nature of the real world of human experience. Developments in the early 90s such as the emergence of the field of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), the introduction of the concept of social navigation (Hook et al. 2003), work on ambient environments, the UbiComp conference series as well as more theoretical positions on embodied or situated interaction (Dourish 2001, McCullough 2005) have all lead the way to a new understanding of HCI. Another driver for this change in emphasis in HCI is the emergence of mobile and ubiquitous computing that has brought significant changes in social and cultural practices in spatial settings. Interactions through and with ubiquitous technologies no longer require physical co-presence and have broadened the range of possible interactions as well as the range of settings in which these interactions can unfold. The basis for this lies in the fact that physical distance no longer prevents many of the types of interactions and encounters that had previously been confined to face-to-face contact. As a result, there has been much discussion on the role of spatial setting and interaction mediated through technologies such as that on the role of space and agency in the quality of the interaction (Dourish and Harrisson 1996) and also the broader concept of the situated behavior and actions (Suchman 1987). A good deal has also been written on the subject of social collaboration among individuals using communication devices and the conditions or features that are required to enable such activities (Gaver 1992; Paulos and Goodman 2004; Hook et al. 2003; Churchill et al. 2004). Further discussion has focused on the technologies themselves, assessing the social impact of the emerging forms of behavior, such as the activities of ad hoc communities enabled through mobile technologies (Rheingold 2002), or the patterns of mobile phones’ use (Katz and Aakhus 2002). Finally, numerous applications and locative media projects (e.g., Harle and Hopper 2005) which explore interactions through realization have been developed. These projects and research offer many useful insights, but there still remain many questions about how to create the conditions for meaningful and persisting shared interactions in public space. The challenge is not only to build systems that respond to rich and dynamic social and physical events, but also to provide a structure for sustainable participation and sharing.},

abstract = {Every day we share encounters with others as we inhabit the space around us. In offering insights and knowledge on this increasingly important topic, this book introduces a range of empirical and theoretical approaches to the study of shared encounters. It highlights the multifaceted nature of collective experience and provides a deeper understanding of the nature and value of shared encounters in everyday life.Divided into four sections, each section comprises a set of chapters on a different topic and is introduced by a key author in the field who provides an overview of the content. The book itself is introduced by Paul Dourish, who sets the theme of shared encounters in the context of technological and social change over the last fifteen years. The four sections that follow consider the characteristics of shared encounters and describe how they can be supported in different settings: the first section, introduced by Barry Brown, looks at shared experiences. George Roussos, in the second section, presents playful encounters. Malcolm McCulloch introduces the section on spatial settings and ' last but not least ' Elizabeth Churchill previews the topic of social glue. The individual chapters that accompany each part offer particular perspectives on the main topic and provide detailed insights from the author's own research background. A valuable reference for anyone designing ubiquitous media, mobile social software and LBS applications, this volume will also be useful to researchers, students and practitioners in fields ranging from computer science to urban studies.},

We propose this simple taxonomy (edit-share-control) as an evolutionary step over the established hierarchical produce-deliver-consume paradigm. Moreover, we demonstrate how each disciplinary effort has contributed to and why the full potential of interactive TV has not yet been fulfilled.

abstract = {The ability to deliver personalized advertising messages has long been a major objective in marketing since it allows marketers to meet heterogeneous consumer needs and target their messages more effectively (Arens \& Bovee, 1994). However, traditional one-to-many marketing approaches applied in mass media suffer from their inability to meet this objective (Dibb, 1998; Hoffman \& Novak, 1997). In order to increase the efficiency of their strategy, marketers identify homogeneous groups of consumers (market segmentation) which they target according to their marketing objectives. Thus, market segmentation has become the most important marketing tool for targeting purposes (McBurnie \& Clutterbuck, 1998), also utilized in the TV advertising domain in conjunction with domain-specific features such as time zones and/or program typologies. However, this strategy has admittedly little to offer towards the ultimate goal of one-to-one communication, since the targeted unit is the segment rather than the individual consumer, and therefore individual needs cannot be satisfied. In the broadcasting television advertising domain, media coverage either exceeds the targeted market segment or leaves potential customers without exposure to the message, thus reducing its cost effectiveness (Belch \& Belch, 1995). At the same time, TV viewers have to deal with a vast amount of available advertising information. The issue of information overload, typical in information theoretic terms, is also experienced in the case of TV advertisements as advertising clutter, which has been identified as one of the significant factors associated with the negative attitude of viewers towards advertising and can have a negative impact on television advertisement recall or recognition (Mord \& Gilson, 1985). Relevant surveys reveal that 80\% of the viewers feel that there is “too much advertising in television” (Elliott \& Speck, 1998), while more than 75\% of consumers are not happy with the broadcasted advertisements (Hawkins, Best, \& Coney, 1998 ). Current target marketing methods are limited in their ability to efficiently target consumers at the individual level, particularly in mass media such as television. Thus, personalization of advertisements provides marketers with the opportunity to increase advertising effectiveness by targeting consumers who are most likely to respond positively to the advertising message. The present article investigates appropriate personalization methods for the domain of digital television advertisements by examining relevant methods utilized for personalized Web applications. In addition, it is concerned with the design of the interactive elements of a typical 30-second advertisement in support of the personalization process. The two objectives of this article are interrelated: the selection of a personalization technique affects the design of interactive advertisements since it indicates the type of interaction data that should be collected in order to enable personalization. The next section of this article opens up the discussion on personalization from a theoretical point of view and in the following section specific personalization techniques are compared. Next, the types of interaction data required to achieve personalization are discussed and the article concludes with further discussion and conclusions.},

In this article, we highlight the state-of-the-art and consider two basic issues: What is interactive TV research? Can it help us reinvent the practices of creating, sharing and watching TV? We survey the literature and identify three concepts that have been inherent in interactive TV research: 1) interactive TV as content creation, 2) interactive TV as a content and experience sharing process, and 3) interactive TV as control of audiovisual content. We propose this simple taxonomy (create-share-control) as an evolutionary step over the traditional hierarchical produce-distribute-consume paradigm. Moreover, we highlight the importance of sociability in all phases of the create-share-control model.},

abstract = {At first glance, the notion of social interactive television seems to be a tautology. Television watching has always been a social activity. People watch television together in their living rooms, and outside their homes they talk about last night's football match; and even call each other to recommend an interesting program. Unfortunately, until recently, research on social interactive television has been scarce. One limiting factor for the development of innovative services for the home is the interactive technology behind user interaction, which was limited to the remote control. Fortunately, a number of studies concentrate on extending interactive methods, for example by using contextual information. This article reviews the state of the art in these two directions: the social aspects of television and user interaction. We conclude with a research agenda for further research, which might transform current interactive television services into shared experiences.},

abstract = {The introduction of mobile and broadband networks in complement to the existing satellite, cable, and terrestrial platforms, opens new opportunities for interactive TV (ITV) applications. In addition, the widespread adoption of multimedia computing has enabled the processing of TV content on personal devices such as mobile phones and PCs. The above developments raise novel issues and require the adoption of new multimedia standards and application frameworks. In particular, the explosion in the amount of available TV channels over digital television platforms (broadcast or internet protocol) makes searching and locating interesting content a cumbersome task. In this context, personalization research is concerned with the adaptation of content (e.g. movies, news, advertisements). Personalization is achieved with the employment of algorithms and data collection schemes that predict and recommend to television viewers content that match their interests. In addition, the distribution of TV content to mobile devices over broadband wireless raises the issue of video quality. Video quality depends on many aspects of the video encoding systems, such as bit rate and algorithms that model human perception of video on small screens. In this article, we examine contemporary research in personalized and mobile digital TV applications. Moreover, we present a critical survey of the most prominent research and provide directions for further research in personalized and mobile digital TV (DTV) applications.},

There is a significant body of related research, but no integrated approach. In the 70’s and 80’s, early video-art installations have explored the links between television, architectural space and community identity. During the 90’s and onwards, the artistic inspiration has caught on with research labs, which developed several distant communication systems. Nevertheless, previous academic research has not been evaluated with casual users in public spaces for prolonged periods of time. As a matter of fact, the most interesting effects of distance communication systems on everyday life, such as community identity, community awareness, and civic participation have not been documented. We plan to deploy an ambient and social interactive TV platform that supports social communication in a positive way. In particular, we describe materials, tools and techniques for a systematic longitudinal evaluation of the social effects of the media communication system on an educational setting. Furthermore, we frame this research program in the wider context of media and architecture academic enquiry.},

Then, the mentality of efficiency and task completion implied by many user interface heuristics may not be suitable for design and expert evaluation of ITV. In line with the contemporary movement towards the design of the user experience of computing systems, a set of design principles for ITV applications has been developed. Instead of information technology, the field of communication science was explored, which has accumulated an extensive theory of TV usage and viewer behavior. For the empirical validation, the principles were employed in the design of an interactive music TV application. The results suggest that a small set of generic principles could support the systematic design of ITV applications and produce a design rationale that is traceable and comparable to alternative solutions, during the process of early product development. In addition, the principles could be refined into specific guidelines and further employed to support expert evaluation techniques.},

Previous works on social television systems belong to two categories: 1) studies on how collocated groups of viewers socialize while watching TV, and 2) studies on novel Social TV applications (e.g. experimental set-ups) and devices (e.g. ambient displays) that provide technological support for TV sociability over a distance. The main shortcoming of those studies is that they have not considered the dominant contemporary method of Social TV. Early adopters of technology have been watching and sharing video online. We employed cultural probes in order to gain in-depth information about the social aspect of video sharing on the internet. Our sample consisted of six heavy users of internet video, watching an average of at least one hour of internet video a day. In particular, we explored how they are integrating video into their daily social communication practices. We found that internet video is shared and discussed with distant friends. Moreover, the results of the study indicate several opportunities and threats for the development of integrated mass and interpersonal communication applications and services.},

In this paper, universal access in ambient intelligence is modeled after the use of TV in everyday life. Instead of considering television only as a content medium and the focus of user activity, an alternative approach is to consider television use as a secondary function to other activities, such as socializing, domestic chores, leisure pursuits. For this purpose, the requirements for ambient user interactivity with TV are organized in a small set of design principles. The design principles have been selected, analyzed and synthesized from readings in previous works on media and ethnographic studies about television, and everyday life. It is suggested that universal access in ambient intelligence is promoted by considering design principles such as opportunistic interaction, user participation, group interactions, and multiple levels of attention to the user interface. Finally, the principles have been tested in the design of a user interface for interactive music television. This preliminary case suggests that the proposed principles facilitate the design of user interfaces that blend seamlessly with everyday life.},

At the same time, the introduction of novel information and communication technologies, such as the digital video recorder (DVR) and efficient Peer-to-Peer (P2P) content distribution, have been regarded as a threat to the established broadcast business players. Previous research has described these threats and has suggested competitive strategies, but it has not investigated the opportunities. This work aims to identify a framework of new business models that take advantage of the networked DVR. For this purpose, we examined the TV literature from diverse academic disciplines, such as mass communication, computer engineering and advertising research. We have also collaborated with network and multimedia engineers, with broadcasters, and we examined novel interactive television (ITV) prototypes. The findings suggest that the networked DVR could be exploited to provide personalized channels and that the dynamic advertising insertion could be introduced as an effective advertising format. In the light of these findings, the TV industry should consider the pro-active adoption and facilitation of the networked DVR infrastructure.},

abstract = {Our everyday lives are characterised by encounters, some are fleeting and ephemeral and others are more enduring and meaningful exchanges. Shared encounters are the glue of social networks and have a socializing effect in terms of mutual understanding, empathy, respect and thus tolerance towards others. The quality and characteristics of such encounters are affected by the setting, or situation in which they occur. In a world shaped by communication technologies, non-place-based networks often coexist alongside to the traditional local face-to-face social networks. As these multiple and distinct on and off-line communities tend to carry out their activities in more and more distinct and sophisticated spaces, a lack of coherency and fragmentation emerges in the sense of a shared space of community. Open public space with its streets, parks and squares plays an important role in providing space for shared encounters among and between these coexisting networks. Mobile and ubiquitous technologies enable social encounters located in public space, albeit not confined to fixed settings, whilst also offering sharing of experiences from non-place based networks. We will look at how to create or support the conditions for meaningful and persisting shared encounters. In particular we propose to explore how technologies can be appropriated for shared interactions that can occur spontaneously and playfully and in doing so re-inhabit and connect place-based social networks.},

abstract = {Animated characters have been a popular research theme, but the respective desktop applications have not been well-received by end-users. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of an animated character for presenting information and navigating music videos within an interactive television (ITV) application. Information was displayed over music video clips with two alternative user interfaces: 1) semi-transparent information overlays, 2) an animated character. For this purpose, the differences between ITV and desktop computing motivated the adaptation of the traditional usability evaluation techniques. The evaluation revealed that users reported higher affective quality with the animated character user interface. Although the success of animated characters in desktop productivity applications has been limited, there is growing evidence that animated characters might be viable in a domestic environment for leisure activities, such as interactive TV.},

In this paper, we argue that unless ITV applications are evaluated with consideration for the ordinary TV viewer, they are going to be appropriate only for the computer literate user, thus excluding the TV audience from easy access to information society services. The field of media studies has accumulated an extensive theory of TV and associated methods. We applied the corresponding findings in the domain of ITV to examine how universal access to ITV applications can be obtained.

@phdthesis{Chorianopoulos2004,
abstract = {This doctoral dissertation aims to investigate user interface (UI) design, implementation and evaluation for interactive television (ITV) applications. Computer mediated entertainment (e.g. video-games, digital music, DVD movies, ITV) has emerged as a major economic factor in the media industry, taking-up a large portion of consumer spending and leisure time. Advances in set-top box technology made possible the digital video recorder (DVR) and Internet connectivity, thus making the television interactive. The objective of the present work is to evaluate the established human-computer interaction (HCI) theory against the requirements of ITV applications. Previous HCI research about ITV focused only on the design of the electronic program guide (EPG) and did not consider the enhancement of the TV content. Furthermore, previous research approached ITV from a single perspective (e.g. computer engineering, advertising, communication) and it did not consider the conflicts of interest between the broadcasters and the consumers, between the developers and the producers, and more crucially, it did not consider the ITV user as a TV viewer. For this purpose, the established TV watching behavior is identified in other scientific disciplines, such as advertising and communication, and it is combined with the Information Technology (IT) usability mentality. The design methodology involves two phases. The objective of the first design phase is to formulate a small set of principal elements that are generic to the design of ITV UIs, such as Virtual Channel conceptual model, UI principles, UI development toolkit, prototyping platform, and affective usability evaluation framework. The objective of the second design phase is to employ the elements identified in the previous stage into the development of an ITV application. The ITV application was evaluated by consumers and addressed three contemporary UI issues: video skipping, animated character, and dynamic advertisement insertion. Overall, the methodology employed a holistic design approach for ITV applications, in which the UI model and the business model were systematically mapped to and validated through an ITV music application. In brief, it was found that the track-skipping UI seamlessly enhanced consumer entertainment. Moreover, it was found that an animated character is preferred, when compared with the traditional transparent box for the presentation of related information. Consumers evaluated the dynamic advertisement insertion positively, thus, opening-up many opportunities for novel advertising formats. The employment of the proposed HCI elements made the design and the development of the ITV application a straightforward process and produced an entertainment experience that was liked by the consumers. The results entail significant implications for the TV industry. ITV is currently perceived as a set of decorative elements, which do not provide any actual improvement of the existing TV content. On the other hand, video-skipping is a familiar functionality that should be exploited, instead of neglected due to the fear of cannibalizing the fixed advertising of the broadcast schedules. The dynamic advertisement insertion in the TV content stream offers a novel advertising format. Finally, there are opportunities for a new mediating role in the media industry that combines the available broadcast transmission with additional elements (Internet resources, computer generated graphics) for the provision of personalized virtual television channels.},

abstract = {This paper presents the innovative approach of the IST project iMEDIA towards Consumer Clustering and Targeted Advertising in a Digital TV Environment. iMEDIA covers the need of Advertising Companies to identify broad classes of TV viewers who will respond similarly to marketing actions, and thus develop their target advertising techniques. The consumers are equipped with a settop box (STB) with storage facilities and a modem. The definition of consumer profiles and clusters is based on demographics, preferences, and analysis of the consumer interactions with the TV, which are tracked automatically. In order to protect consumers’ identities, consumer data are stored locally on the STB and the classification of a consumer in a specific cluster takes place at the client side. Consumer data from the consumers, who permit it, is periodically transferred to the Server where Data Mining techniques are applied. The extracted consumer behavioral rules associate the clusters with consumer profiles and interaction/navigational data and are sent through the broadcast channel to the consumers’ STBs for the classification of each consumer and the playback of the advertisements that match consumer interests.},

Although personalisation is a practice used widely on the Internet by many sites, applying personalisation techniques over interactive television presents a number of difficulties. In this paper we focus on the design and testing process of the User Interface (UI) for the Interactive \& Personalized Advertisement TV viewer.
